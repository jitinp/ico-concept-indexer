The Ammbr network will be composed of Ammbr units, which act like advanced routers. These units mutually relay data with each other and, by doing so, they grant the end users Internet access, especially in areas where the Internet coverage is currently poor. The units use a wide range of advanced wireless technologies, allowing them to be very flexible and to cover long distances. The complexity of the device will not influence the overall user experience, which will be similar to what a current “standard” router provides when a user wants to join a LAN to connect to the Internet.",

Developers can develop and add new assets through an open plugins system keeping the wallet lightweight. The second component is a validator hosted on the Safenetwork. Users will connect to the Safenetwork through the wallet to exchange. An application will match the orders issued by the users and check all transactions and order informations are valid. Unlike centralized and semi-centralized exchanges, there isn’t a wallet acting as a relay. Transactions are processed simultaneously through an order matching engine from one wallet to another. The validator on the Safenetwork will check if the transactions are valid prior to being exchanged. The orders are then matched and transactions broadcasted in their respective networks. The validator process raw transactions and doesn’t hold any private keys or assets nor can it sign transactions resulting in a trustless decentralized exchange using the Safenetwork to validate orders.",

Some zones act as hubs with respect to other zones, allowing many zones to interoperate through a shared hub. The architecture is a more general application of the Bitcoin sidechains concept, using classic BFT and Proof-of-Stake algorithms, instead of Proof-of-Work.\nCosmos can interoperate with multiple other applications and cryptocurrencies, something other blockchains can’t do well. By creating a new zone, you can plug any blockchain system into the Cosmos hub and pass tokens back and forth between those zones, without the need for an intermediary.\nFor example, if you wanted to trade bitcoins for ether today, you would have to sell your bitcoins for a fiat currency on an open exchange and then use that fiat currency to buy ether on another exchange. The problem is, many of our exchanges today are plagued by hacks, theft, and cons. Two prime examples are what happened at Mt. Gox and more recently Bitfinex.",

	"concept": "The core objective behind the existence of DAO.Casino is to replace centralised casino models with a socio-economic protocol with no human intervention whatsoever. This decentralized system will achieve a fine balance between active participation and a fair economic return for those who participate. For developers, DAO.Casino proposes to eliminate their need to rely on centralized casinos. Instead, the protocol makes it easier for these talented individuals and teams to monetise their work, raise funds, and expect bankrolling without paying heavy commissions.For gamers, DAO.Casino is equally attractive, as it allows them to break free from rigged centralised online casinos. Traditional casinos are a black box; players cannot call their bluff easily, because the outcomes of each bet are calculated behind closed curtains. DAO.Casino, on the other hand, allows for transparency. The protocol focuses on obtaining pseudorandomness in all the gaming outcomes by introducing an economic incentive layer. Here, the participants interact with PRNG contracts to ensure unpredictable pseudorandomness. In the beginning we expect existing licensed online casino operators to integrate with the protocol to reduce costs, while long-term new forms of regulations more suitable for decentralised, transparent and automated systems can emerge.",

The offer may expire anytime once all 25,000,000 COSS tokens are sold.

Genaro has pioneered the concept of Blockchain 3.0, a platform built around the first Turing-complete public chain with decentralized storage network. This means blockchain developers have a one-stop solution to deploy smart contracts and store data simultaneously.  The technological ecosystem will contribute to blockchain infrastructure technology development and is supported by a series of Hubs with an in-house Accelerator, being established in Singapore, Shanghai, and Silicon Valley. This combined system of technology standards and infrastructure will enable incubation of hundreds, and then thousands, of decentralized applications (DAPPs) built on the Genaro Network, becoming the first app store of the blockchain. The Genaro Public Chain uses PoS (Proof of Stake) as consensus, and creatively uses the SPoR (Sentinel Proof of Retrievability) algorithm as its storage consensus, which could increase both public chain scalability and file transferring speed. Moreover, Genaro applies game theory to a sharing economy business model, thereby establishing a fairer rewards system for nodes and provides end users with a private, efficient, economic, secure and permanent storage space and sharing community.",

By this they are tackling the issue of escheatment in the digital domain. Their plan is to set up an infrastructure that will become an industry wide standard for the future generations to come. With the increasing usage of cryptocurrencies the problem of leaving your assets to inheritors is becoming more and more important. Currently none of the digital vaults offer this possibility and the user can’t be sure that the paper wallet will be delivered to the rightful inheritor.",

Flyp.me is built and managed by the team at HolyTransaction, one of the first web wallets to support Ethereum, the first multi-currency web wallet and the oldest still active.

The ticketing industry is plagued with problems.  Consumers are blocked from the primary market due to the proliferation of sophisticated resellers who use bots to buy up the majority of tickets.  When consumers are able to access the primary market, typically only subpar seats are available – and customers must pay exorbitant fees to secure those seats.  If tickets to an event are sold out, consumers typically turn to the secondary market to source their tickets.  On the secondary market, they also pay high fees and risk fraud due to the lack of transparency.

The proposed design provides users with high liquidity at all times, reduce spreads, prevent \"flash crashes\" and improve traders' welfare. BBOD system uses elliptic curves post-quantum cryptography, which is secure against all known quantum algorithms and on-chain encrypt all sensitive transaction data like price and volume. The BBOD platform makes it possible to either protect cryptocurrency investments against crashes or speculate on price changes using a wide range of digital tokens (eg. Ethereum, Qtum, GNT).

This is achieved through Ad Campaign Smart Contracts initiated by advertisers. This protocol is developed for any ad-driven media platform to use and build upon; video-based, audio-based, written, or mixed. This means that the Signal Token utility is not fixed to Spectiv. Rather, it is built to be its own decentralized, autonomous protocol that can support multiple attention economies. Each media platform can integrate its own unique mechanisms for monitoring genuine attention data, contributing to the long-term effectiveness of the protocol. Decentralized protocols make great sense in theory, but are often faced with a fatal challenge when applied to the real world: early adoption. Without a dedicated early adopter to champion a new product, it can be extremely difficult to generate traction and compete with established players. Spectiv serves as the pioneer and first use case for the Signal Token Protocol. Spectiv’s mission is to become the foundational layer for connecting and transacting rewards between advertisers, publishers, curators and viewers across a variety of platforms, the first of which is Spectiv VR.",

In the simplest cases, creating a digital product offer is done with only a few clicks and does not require vendors to install any software. Purchasing digital products is a simple process too. Buyers make all payments in the Ethereum blockchain`s native currency – ETH.  Creating sale offers, as well as buying products is done with the use of software, based on MyEtherWallet – one of the most popular Ethereum online wallets. That allows the service to be used on both desktops and mobile devices.",

The DAO IPCI ecosystem allows diverse stakeholders (governments, civil society, businesses and individuals) to participate directly in mitigation activities, register quantified commitments, invest in green projects, offset carbon footprint, acquire and trade mitigation outcomes.From its launch in early 2016 DAO IPCI has brought together experienced blockchain and green finance developers along with globally renowned experts who formed the advisory board. Minimum necessary functional of the DAO IPCI protocol and decentralized application have been in place since late 2016.  Several months later DAO IPCI reached a historical milestone - the very first world - wide carbon credit transaction using blockchain technology.\nMitigation Token (MITO) is a protocol-based ERC20 token acting as market exchange vehicle, designed to represent environmental and climate mitigation costs including carbon price.\nAt the post-token sale stage strict correlation of the MITO and 3-rd party verified environmental mitigation assets will be ensured, hedging price volatility of green finance markets. New MITO issues will be only possible one year after the Initial Token Offering, whilst 50% of newly issued tokens shall be distributed among existing MITO holders.",

PayPie is a faster, safer, and smart contract-powered credit scoring and lending platform for banks, lenders, and invoice factoring companies. The platform solves the problems of fraud and inconsistencies which exist in isolated accounting systems by allowing for real-time audit and analysis of financial statements on the blockchain. This analysis will be done using a decentralized single ledger approach and will consider the all-time historical accounting information of participating businesses to safeguard and transform the way credit risk is assessed by lenders, investors, and other financial institutions.

Multi-hash mining creates robust incentives for miners to deliver efficient, reliable security.\nZen smart contracts are written and secured by a subset of the F* functional programming language, allowing users to: \nA) Prove the amount of resources a contract will consume and provide the necessary fees for running the contract to miners, removing the need for a “gas” based system.\nB) Prove their contracts meet a given specification, meaning they can prove the contract will definitely do (or not do) something given a specific set of parameters.\nThe Zen platform comes with a built-in solution for oracles, which provide contracts with useful real world data.\nFinally, Zen is integrated with the Bitcoin blockchain, allowing contracts to observe and respond to native bitcoin transactions",

It avoids its potential downside by employing scarcity (the number of Xaurum Gamma tokens is limited), guaranteeing a minimal value through its use (Xaurum Gamma tokens can be used to rent a villa at the rate 1 XGM : 100 € or higher when recapitalized) and the growth of its xaurum reserves.",

The Sharpe proprietary investment fund utilises cutting edge Machine Learning technology to deliver returns that consistently beat the stock market, with low volatility and an excellent Sharpe ratio (typically 2.5+). Their trading ledger smart contract maintains a real-time public record of all investment activity on the blockchain, such that sentiment rewards can be paid to token holders in a decentralised and autonomous way. Subject to obtaining regulatory sign-off, they will be a blockchain start-up to issue a fully-regulated crypto-security token. They plan to issue Sharpe Crypto-Derivative (SCD) tokens to all holders of SHP, at a rate of 1-to-1. SCD will be a dividend-paying token, which tracks the performance of the Sharpe proprietary fund and pays an Ether profit-share to token holders on a biannual basis.",

Planning and executing geographically centralised votes is long and expensive - and infrequent as a result. Paired with blockchain, Horizon State delivers convenient voting to mobiles and PCs, with immediacy. Traditional methods of voting cost taxpayers upwards of $7 per vote to facilitate- $25 in some cases. Horizon State’s blockchain voting solution is far cheaper, remaining under $0.50.",
